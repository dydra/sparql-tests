The manifest.ttl for the SERVICE tests cases contains new vocabulary not used before. The SERVICE tests check whether the queries with that operator are correct or not. For that it is necessary to query remote SPARQL endpoints in a query and a way to describe the data comming from these endpoints is needed. We added the predicate <http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/test-query#serviceData> to the manifest.ttl file. This predicate helps to describe the data comming from these remote SPARQL endpoints in a query. This predicate also contains the predicate <http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/test-query#endpoint> which contains the URL of the remote SPARQL endpoint.
